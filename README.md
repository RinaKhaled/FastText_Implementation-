# FastText_Implementation
Implementation of FastText from scratch and comparing it to a pre-trained model
# Conclusion:
The Pretrained Model got better results because it was trained on larger dataset, and it probably was trained with more epochs. As for our model, it was trained only on first 1000 words with 100 epochs only.
